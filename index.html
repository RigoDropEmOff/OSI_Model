<header>What is the OSI Model?</header><p>The OSI Model, or Open Systems Interconnection Model, is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose in facilitating communication between devices in a network.</p><p>Understanding the OSI Model is crucial for network professionals as it provides a common language for discussing and designing network architectures. The model aids in troubleshooting, protocol development, and the conceptualization of network interactions.</p></section>

<header>Physical Layer</header>
<h2>Functions:</h2><p>The Physical Layer deals with the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium. It defines the hardware characteristics, such as cables, connectors, and signaling, necessary for transmitting binary data.
<h2>Devices:</h2><p>Devices operating at this layer include hubs, repeaters, and network adapters. They focus on the electrical and mechanical aspects of data transmission.</p>
<h2>Protocals:</h2><p>Protocols like Ethernet and RS-232C operate at the Physical Layer. Ethernet, for example, determines how bits are placed on the network medium.</p><h2>Examples:</h2><ul><li>Transmitting voltages over copper wires</li><li>Specifying cable types (e.g., Cat5e, Fiber Optic)</li><li>Defining connector types (e.g., RJ45)</li></ul>
<pre><code data-line-number="1"># Example: Sending bits over a physical medium (simulation)
def send_bits(data):
    for bit in data:
        send_bit_over_medium(bit)

def send_bit_over_medium(bit):
    # Code to send a bit over the physical medium
    print(f"Sending bit: {bit}")

# Example usage
data_to_send = "10101011"
send_bits(data_to_send).</code></pre>

<section class="main-section" id="Data_Link_Layer">
<header>Data Link Layer</header>
<h2>Functions:</h2><p>The Data Link Layer provides error detection and correction within the physical layer's raw bit stream. It is responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes and managing access to the shared medium.</p>
<h2>Devices:</h2><p>Common devices at this layer are switches and bridges. They operate based on MAC addresses and use protocols like Ethernet to ensure data integrity and efficient communication within a local network.</p>
<h2>Protocals:</h2><p>Protocols like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) operate at the Data Link Layer. ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, while PPP facilitates point-to-point communication.</p><h2>Examples:</h2><ul><li>MAC address assignment</li><li>Frame synchronization</li><li>Error detection and correction</li></ul>
<pre><code data-line-number="1"># Example: Simulating MAC address resolution with ARP
def resolve_mac_address(ip_address):
    # Code to perform ARP and resolve MAC address
    mac_address = lookup_mac_address(ip_address)
    return mac_address

def lookup_mac_address(ip_address):
    # Code to look up MAC address in ARP table or request it
    return "00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e"

# Example usage
ip_to_resolve = "192.168.1.1"
resolved_mac = resolve_mac_address(ip_to_resolve)
print(f"MAC address for {ip_to_resolve}: {resolved_mac}")

    <section class="main-section" id="Network_Layer">
      <header>Network Layer</header>
   <h2>Functions:</h2><p>The Network Layer focuses on routing and forwarding data between different networks. It determines the optimal path for data packets to reach their destination, considering logical addressing and routing protocols.</p><h2>Devices:</h2><p>Routers operate at the Network Layer, making decisions based on IP addresses. They connect multiple networks and enable communication across diverse environments.</p>
<h2>Protocals:</h2><p>IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) are key protocols at the Network Layer. IP handles addressing and routing, while ICMP manages error reporting.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2><ul><li>IP address assignment
</li><li>Packet forwarding and routing
</li><li>Subnetting and CIDR notation</li></ul>
<pre><code data-line-number="1"># Example: Simulating IP packet forwarding with a router
def forward_ip_packet(packet, destination_ip):
    # Code to determine the next hop and forward the IP packet
    next_hop = determine_next_hop(destination_ip)
    send_packet_to_next_hop(packet, next_hop)

def determine_next_hop(destination_ip):
    # Code to perform routing table lookup and determine the next hop
    next_hop = lookup_routing_table(destination_ip)
    return next_hop

def send_packet_to_next_hop(packet, next_hop):
    # Code to send the IP packet to the next hop
    print(f"Forwarding packet to {next_hop}: {packet}")

     <section class="main-section" id="Transport_Layer">
      <header>Transport Layer</header>
      <h2>Functions:</h2><p>The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end communication by providing error recovery, flow control, and reordering of data segments. It segments and reassembles data, providing reliability to the communication process.</p><h2>Devices:</h2><p>some of the devices used in the transport layer include a gateway and a firewall. A gateway is a component in computer networking that connects two networks that use separate protocols. The gateway is a protocol converter that converts one protocol to another. A router is a subset of a gateway.
A firewall is a system that is meant to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Some of the functions of a firewall include packet filtering and acting as a proxy server.</p>
<h2>Protocals:</h2><p>Key protocols at this layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), each with distinct characteristics suitable for specific applications.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2><ul><li>Segmentation and reassembly of data</li><li>Flow control and error recovery</li><li>Multiplexing and demultiplexing</li></ul>
<pre><code data-line-number="1"># Example: Simulating reliable data transfer with TCP
def send_data_using_tcp(data):
    # Code to establish a TCP connection, send data, and close the connection
    establish_tcp_connection()
